    "## Credit Card Engagement and Share of Wallet Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involved the comprehensive analysis of customer engagement with Internal cards (An imaginary company i work for) versus external cards, utilizing dummy data created specifically for this purpose. The primary focus was on tracking and diagnosing Share of Wallet (SoW) trends, identifying drivers of customer disengagement, and delivering actionable insights to enhance customer engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Objectives:**\n",
    "- Analyze customer behavior and spending patterns across different card types using generated dummy data.\n",
    "- Track Share of Wallet trends to understand market penetration and customer loyalty.\n",
    "- Identify pockets and drivers of customer disengagement to mitigate churn.\n",
    "- Provide strategic recommendations to optimize customer engagement and increase market share.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "The project utilized a combination of transactional data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques applied to the dummy data. Both internal (American Express cards) and external market data were simulated to provide a comprehensive view of customer preferences and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome:**\n",
    "The analysis enabled a deeper understanding of customer satisfaction, spending habits, and engagement levels across card types. Insights derived from the project informed strategic decisions aimed at improving customer retention and maximizing profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates proficiency in data analytics, strategic thinking, and the ability to leverage insights from simulated data to address real-world challenges in the financial services industry.\n"
